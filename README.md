After knitting and rendering `BGCprojections_predict.Rmd`, overwrite this file with a symlink to `BGCprojections_predict.md`.

E.g., on Linux/macOS from terminal:

```bash
cd C:/Users/cbarros/GitHub/BCGov/CCISS/SpaDES/modules/BGCprojections_predict
rm README.md && ln -s BGCprojections_predict.md README.md
```
